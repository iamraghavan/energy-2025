- Font: 'Bebas Neue', a sans-serif font as per user request. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean and modern icons for sports categories, ensuring they are easily recognizable and non-3D.

- Subtle animations for score updates and transitions, avoiding any 3D effects, to keep the interface fluid.
